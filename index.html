<!-- we want to be able to enter in the name and then get the data back from our api and then display that in the browser -->
<!-- express handles the spaces for us -->
<!-- when the user clicks the button we want them to be able to grab the val the name out of here right and we want them to be able to make a request to our server so what's the only thing that can listen for this button click and grab the value out of this input? -->
    <!-- an eventlistner -->
     <!-- and to use eventlistners, what type of javascript do we need? -->
        <!-- good old client-side javascript -->
         <!-- our rap-name-api doesn't have a clientside javascript, so we need to go ahead and create it: -->
            <!-- 
         - mkdir js
         - cd js
         - touch main.js
         
          -->
